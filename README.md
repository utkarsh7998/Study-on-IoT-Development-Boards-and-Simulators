Question 1
Comparative Study of IoT Development Boards: Perform a detailed comparative study of at least
six different development boards used in the current IoT applications. Your study should at least cover
the following aspects relevant to the boards:
• Hardware details 
• On board storage
• Power consumption
• Supported Operating systems
• Supported communication protocols
• GPIO
• Cost of the board
• Supported sensors
• Any limitations
You are encouraged to explore any other relevant aspects that you feel are important that should
be covered.
Don’t choose all the boards from the same family or manufacturer. Try to select development boards
that are as diverse as possible.
In the end, write a summary of the insights you have gained from this comparative study, like the
major design choices and their advantages and disadvantages. Mention all the sources that you use to
perform this comparative study under references.



Question 2 - Study on Popular IoT Simulators
Discuss different popular simulators that simulate IoT systems. Write about what development boards,
communication protocols, sensors, and any other relevant aspects of IoT systems they support.
Make a comparison summary between these simulators and mention the positives and negatives
you have found about them. Mention all the sources that you use under references.

Question 3 - Application Survey
Write about different IoT applications in which the development boards you studied in question 1 are
used. Mention why that particular board was chosen for that application. Write at least one application
for each IoT development board you have studied in Question 1. Mention all the sources that you use
to under references.
